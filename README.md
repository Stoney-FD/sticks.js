Sticks.js
=========

What is it?
-----------

Sticks.js is client-side javascript library, which can be used for two things:

1. Templating (which is its preferred use)
2. Converting JSON objects into XML objects

Sticks.js relies heavily on jQuery.

Features:
- Lightweight and small (less than 150 lines of code, and it's not even minified)
- Customizable (Using the sticks.options object)
- Moustache-like templating


How does it work?
-----------------

Add jQuery and sticks.js to the head of your web page. (Or whereever you prefer to load
your scripts.)



Why re-invent the wheel? There are already a few templating engines out there...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While I really like ejs with Node.js and express.js, I recently stumbled upon a blog post
explaining the Nova templating engine (which is for node.js only), I really missed having
a template engine like that for the browser.
As much as I like Node.js, I don't always need or want
